# Welcome to card-match ♣️
A simple card matching game :)

## About
This game was made following [this article]() which explains in details how I made it.

## How to play
Click on a card to see it's hidden picture. Try to find another card which has the same picture as that card. 
* If the second card's hidden picture does not match with the first, try again 💫
* If you manage to properly match all the cards, __bravo!__ 🎉
* Careful 🛑 There's a 1 card that does not matchy of the others, _beware of the joker 🃏_

## Start playing
   
To run it, just clone the repository and open __index.html__ on your brower.
